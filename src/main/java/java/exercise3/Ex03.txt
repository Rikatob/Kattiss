HashMap has O(1) because it use a algorithms that is as good as "constant" to add, remove or find items and for getting the size of the hashmap.
Each "bucket" should contain a constant range of hashCodes and the items will be placed in the map accordingly to the hashCode and not the order they were added.
if for some reason every entry was put in one bucket the runtime would be O(n), but this is not likely to happen.

the graph has worstcase O(n) because there is a possibility that it must go through all the nodes.

Me waiting with this task to the end = O(2^n), witch is bad!
